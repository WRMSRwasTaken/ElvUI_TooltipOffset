# ElvUI_TooltipOffset
ElvUI plugin to add an option to offset the tooltip if anchor is set to "CURSOR". Idea taken from TipTac.

This is a re-upload of the ElvUI tooltip offset plugin, after the TukUI website has been hacked and this addon hasn't been uploaded to the new website (yet).

This is a slightly modified version of the original version 1.2, using the official ElvUI plugin api to load additional modules.
